I used GitHub CoPilot. I used in the following scenarios:
- To save time writing basic structure of code. 
  - When creating multiple Command classes, I used it to create a skeleton of the Classes.
    - Observation: It was mostly helpful but missed inheriting from the abstract Command class and missed parameters for the methods
  - When writing switch statements, I used it to generate the cases.
    - Observation: It was able to list down all cases but the handling of cases had to be done manually.
- To save time when having to rewrite code the same way multiple times.
  - When I had to trim() user input while parsing or add //Fallthrough for switch cases.
    - Observation: It was able to understand what changes I wanted after I made the initial change for one case.
- To save time writing JavaDoc comments.
  - When I had to write JavaDoc comments for a methods and classes.
    - Observation: It was able to generate the JavaDoc comments for the method, but I had to manually change the comments to be more accurate.

Other Observations on GitHub CoPilot:
There were moments where it gave irrelevant suggestions while I was writing code without expecting suggestions. 
It was annoying at times when the suggestions got implemented when I did not want it to.

I also used ChatGPT to generate the responses from Alastor in hopes of getting a response with the right personality and tone.
It took multiple tries to get a response that sounded okay. Often times the suggestions were too long or too short, 
compared to what I was hoping for.
